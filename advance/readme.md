1.The code demonstrates how to fetch data from a server using XMLHttpRequest (XHR) — a key part of AJAX. It starts by defining a GitHub API URL for user data and creating an XHR object that acts as a messenger between the browser and the server. The open('GET', URL) method sets up a GET request, while onreadystatechange monitors the request’s progress. When readyState reaches 4, it means the response is fully received. The response text (in string form) is then converted to a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(), allowing direct access to data like the user’s followers. Finally, send() dispatches the request, and the whole process happens asynchronously without reloading the pag

2.A complete demonstration of how Promises and asynchronous operations work in JavaScript. It starts with promiseOne, which simulates an asynchronous task using setTimeout that completes after 1 second. When the task finishes, it calls resolve(), and the attached .then() logs "Promise consumed", showing how to consume a promise once it is fulfilled. A similar approach is demonstrated in promiseThree, which resolves with a JavaScript object containing username and email. The .then() attached to it receives this object as a parameter and logs it, demonstrating how promise values can carry meaningful data.
promiseFour introduces conditional resolve/reject logic, where a simulated error determines whether the promise succeeds or fails. Its chained .then() handlers first log the resolved object and then extract and log just the username. If the promise rejects, the .catch() logs the error, and .finally() runs regardless of success or failure, indicating that the promise is settled.
promiseFive shows a modern way of consuming promises using async/await. The promise resolves or rejects after 1 second based on a simulated error, and the consumePromiseFive async function uses try…catch to handle success or failure in a clean, readable way.
Finally, the code uses the fetch() API to retrieve GitHub user data. The response is first converted to JSON using response.json(), then logged in the next .then(), with a .catch() to handle any network or fetch errors.
Overall, this code illustrates multiple ways to create, consume, and chain promises, handle errors, and combine them with modern async/await and fetch calls to work with asynchronous tasks and API responses in JavaScript.

The Fetch API is a modern, promise-based interface in JavaScript used to make HTTP requests to servers. When you call fetch(url, options), a Request object is created containing the URL, method, headers, and body (if any), and it is sent over the network asynchronously. The server processes the request and returns a Response object containing the status, headers, and body data. The fetch call immediately returns a Promise that resolves when the response is received. You can then process the response body using methods like json(), text(), or blob(), and handle network errors using .catch(). Unlike older approaches, fetch does not automatically reject on HTTP errors (like 404 or 500), so you must check response.ok or response.status. Overall, Fetch provides a cleaner, more modern way to work with asynchronous requests and responses in JavaScript.
